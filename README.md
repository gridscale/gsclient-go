# The gridscale Go Client

This is a client for the gridscale API. It can be used to make an application interact with the gridscale cloud platform to create and manage resources.

## Preparation for Use

To be able to use this client a number of steps need to be taken. First a gridscale account will be required, which can be created [here](https://my.gridscale.io/signup/). Then an API-token [should be created](https://my.gridscale.io/APIs/).

## Installation

First the Go programming language will need to be installed. This can be done by using [the official Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) or by using the packages provided by your distribution.
 
Downloading the gridscale Go client can be done with the following go command:

```
go get "github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go"
```

## Using the gridscale Client

To be able to use the gridscale Go client in an application it can be imported in a go file. This can be done with the following code:

```go
import (
	"github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go"
)
```

To get access to the functions of the Go client, a Client type needs to be created. This requires a Config type. Both of these can be created with the following code: 

```go
config := gsclient.NewConfiguration("User-UUID", "API-token")
client := gsclient.NewClient(config)
```

Make sure to replace the user-UUID and API-token strings with valid credentials or variables containing valid credentials. It is recommended to use environment variables for them.

## Using API endpoints

After having created a Client type, as shown above, it will be possible to interact with the API. An example would be the [Servers Get endpoint](https://gridscale.io/en/api-documentation/index.html#servers-get):

```go
servers := client.GetServerList()
```

For creating and updating/patching objects in gridscale, it will be required to use the respective CreateRequest and UpdateRequest types. For creating an SSH-key that would be SshkeyCreateRequest and SshkeyUpdateRequest. Here an example:

```go
requestBody := gsclient.IpCreateRequest {
	Family: 6,
	Name:   "IpTest",
}

client.CreateIp(requestBody)
```

What options are available for each create and update request can be found in the source code. After installing it should be located in: 
```
~/go/src/github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go
```

## Known Issues
The following issues are known to us:

* L3security isn't read in the network relation of a server.
* The autorecovery attribute of a server can't be changed with this client.
